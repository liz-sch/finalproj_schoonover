This project is an attempt at a shopping cart management system. It was intended to register users, and allow 
them to add products to a shopping cart. The products would be loaded into the product.db file by the vendor,
and displayed on the 'For Sale' page. Users would be able to register under the 'Sign Up' page, and then add products
to a cart, then checkout. Upon checkout, the order log would be generated and saved by the cart function. The included
diagrams are meant to illustrate this process in detail.

You may have noticed that the code for this project is incomplete. I apologize for this, as I completed what I could
in the time I had. I did not want to leave my submission empty, so I am turning in what I have. I managed to successfully
create and load the SQL databases, but I was unable to load this data into the main site. I also successfully had the site
running, but that was about as far as I managed to get. Again, I apologize and I hope to do better next semester.
Thank you.
